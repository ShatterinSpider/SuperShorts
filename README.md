# SuperShorts
I improved upon this youtube auto short upload code, to turn it from a bot tool to a creator tool that'll automatically upload your clipped shorts or replays from OBS. Macro coming soon but executable python script works.

If code doesn't work it'll most likely be the ChromeDriver that needs an update -
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/home

Just download and replace it in the folder if I haven't updated it.

Follow Original Video for Chrome://Version steps, Copy Path and Executable Path as follows. Every "\" will need to be doubled as my original modified code.

REPLAY BUFFER
Rename Backtrack_Video.mp4 to your Replay Buffer file name to make it work
